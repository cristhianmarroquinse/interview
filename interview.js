// // Cache

// // Translation
// translation.translate("English Source Text"); // Returns a promise that resolves to a string containing the translation as a string.

// // Speech
// speech.speak("Texto fuente en espa√±ol"); // Returns a promise that resolves to a readable stream that will stream binary data (async).

// // Storage
// storage.pipe(stream); // Returns a promise that resolves to a fake URL once the stream has ended. A unique URL for each source text will be provided.
